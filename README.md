# Odin Landing Page

A simple landing page made from scratch using flexbox and basic CSS techniques, in accordance to [design layout](https://github.com/qweasd777/landing-page?tab=readme-ov-file#screenshots) given. 

## About

My first landing page project following The Odin Project's (TOP) Foundations Course. 

The main objective is for us to familiarise ourselves in developing a webpage from scratch with CSS techniques learnt so far. The only constraints were to get the landing page to look similar to the [design layout](https://github.com/qweasd777/landing-page?tab=readme-ov-file#screenshots) given.
